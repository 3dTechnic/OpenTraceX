# OpenTraceX
OpenTrace: The open-source frame and API for turning paper sketches into production-ready vectors.
We all know it - we want to make a simple box for our tools but modeling each tool on its own is way too much work!



As a programmer, I know that it's better to spend 7 hours fixing a problem than to just do something. That's why I built the

# OpenTraceX!

Your perfect choice for quick and easy modeling – not just for 3D printers, it can be used for laser cutters, CNC machines and a lot more!



So what are you waiting for?

# Build and Usage

Obviously you want to build the **OpenTraceX** now but you're asking yourself how you can do that.

Information on the software side of things is on Github (here). The 3D models are [on Makerworld]([https://makerworld.com/de/@3dTechnic/upload](https://makerworld.com/de/models/2264438-opentracex-free-and-diy-version-of-shaper-trace#profileId-2467710)).

If you have any questions, be quick to reach out in the comments on Makerworld and I'll try to help you as soon as I can.



# Known issues:

Will be expanded when needed.

- When the size of the model is too big, try setting the scale from 1 to 0.393700787 instead. It might be a unit problem.
- For Fusion 360, you might have to set the size to 0.3735 or similar to get the correct scaling.
- If the scaling is too far off, try taking the picture from straight up to prevent warping issues.

**Yours,**

# Software Guide
To use the software, just download the flaskServer.py, trace_to_svg.py and requirements.txt.

To set it up for the first time, put all of those files into one folder.
## Python is required, so if you do not have Python, install it now.
- Navigate to that folder in the command line.
- Run the following command: **pip install -r requirements.txt".**
- If this doesn't work, switch the **pip** for **pip3**

### Now, you're almost ready to go.
The project is ready to be turned on, you can turn it on by running **python flask_server.py** or **python3 flask_server.py** (whichever of these works without errors).
